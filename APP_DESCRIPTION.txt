# PROJECT OVERVIEW: MIDITypist (v3.1)

## 1. Core Concept
MIDITypist is a high-performance Windows desktop automation tool that translates MIDI input (Notes, CC, Velocity, Chords) into system-level keyboard and mouse commands. It is designed to turn any musical MIDI controller into a programmable macro-pad for professional workflows, accessibility, or gaming.

## 2. Technical Architecture (Hybrid Engine)
- **Backend (C++)**:
    - **MIDI Engine**: Utilizes `RtMidi` for low-latency, cross-platform MIDI input handling.
    - **Automation**: Uses Win32 API (`SendInput`) for system-level keystroke and mouse movement injection.
    - **Core Logic**: Manages persistent JSON configurations, profile switching, and per-app auto-reconnect logic.
- **Frontend (WebView2)**:
    - **Interface**: A premium, macOS Sonoma-inspired "Glassmorphism" UI built with HTML5/CSS3/JS.
    - **Bridge**: A custom JSON-based bidirectional bridge allows real-time communication between the C++ engine and the web UI (e.g., Piano Roll visualization, status logs).
- **Persistence**: Configurations and mappings are stored in structured JSON files for easy portability and community sharing.

## 3. Current Feature Set
- **Mapping Engine**: Supports MIDI Note and Control Change (CC) mapping to specific Virtual Keys (VK).
- **Velocity Zones**: Advanced logic allows different keystrokes based on "Soft" vs "Hard" key strikes.
- **Mouse & Scroll Emulation**: Map MIDI sliders (CC) to control mouse cursor movement (X/Y) or vertical scrolling.
- **Per-App Profile Switching**: Automatically detects the active foreground window and switches MIDI mappings (e.g., Loading a "Photoshop" profile when Photoshop is focused).
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time CSS/SVG Piano Roll and system logs for debugging MIDI signals.
- **System Tray Integration**: Can run invisible in the background with auto-reconnect support for MIDI devices.

## 4. Current State
The application is functionally complete as a bridge. It is currently "Generic" in that it provides a 1-to-1 or 1-to-many mapping for simple events. It avoids the bloat of DAW-based MIDI mapping by staying lightweight and system-native.

## 5. Development Goals
The next phase of development focuses on "Novelty and Power." The aim is to introduce features that traditional MIDI-to-key mappers (like MIDI2KEY or BOME) lack, specifically leveraging the hybrid web-interface or the underlying C++ engine to provide "Context-Aware" automation.

## 6. Question for Experts
"How can we leverage the high-performance C++ engine and the flexible WebView2 UI to create a MIDI automation tool that feels like a 'Second Brain' for a computer user? What novel, high-value use cases exist for MIDI data beyond simple button mapping (e.g., Data Visualization, AI-assisted macros, non-linear desktop control)?"
